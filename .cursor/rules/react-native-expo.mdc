# React Native & Expo Standards for Friendlines

## Core Principles
- Follow Expo SDK v53 patterns and best practices
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Implement responsive design with SafeAreaView and proper spacing
- Follow the established theme system in `src/styles/theme.ts`

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Import React explicitly: `import React from 'react'`
- Use StyleSheet.create for styling, never inline styles
- Follow the established spacing scale from theme
- Use SafeAreaView for screen-level components

## Navigation
- Use React Navigation v7 patterns
- Type navigation props with established param lists
- Use proper accessibility labels for tab navigation
- Follow the stack/tab navigation structure established

## Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper key props for lists
- Use FlatList for long lists, ScrollView for short content
- Implement proper loading states

## Platform Considerations
- Use Platform.OS for platform-specific code
- Handle safe areas properly with react-native-safe-area-context
- Test on both iOS and Android patterns

## Dependencies
- Prefer Expo-managed modules over bare React Native
- Use established dependencies from package.json
- Follow version compatibility with Expo SDK v53
